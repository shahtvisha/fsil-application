## Project README

### Project Overview

This project leverages Jupyter Notebook and PyCharm with Python and Streamlink to analyze data from T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon. These companies are pivotal players in the telecommunications industry, maintaining significance throughout technological evolution. The analysis delves into how these companies respond to risk, evaluating the effectiveness of their strategies. Understanding these responses not only fosters trust in the company's decision-making but also enables users to gauge the efficacy of their teams and decisions. Allowing users to understand risk factors, companies response and performace of their response will help users understand make an informed decision before investing and a greater perspective on a companies setback and strategies. 

I've deployed RAG with Mistral, Chromadb for vectorization, and Ollama's enviornment. These tools form the backbone of our technical approach, for text analysis with LLMs. Although the UI showcases our progress, it currently remains unconnected to the model due to GPU and time constraints.

### Time Constraint

While the project demonstrates my coding capabilities, unforeseen time constraints hindered its completion. Despite near-perfect execution, an unexpected GPU disconnection prevented the visualization of insights and further insights extraction and also led toloss of my already executed code. To run everything again, especially vectorization would have taken me 2/3 hours more, which will exceed the dealine. If my exams didn't just end around 14 hours ago, I would have gotten a headstart. Given more time, I am confident in my ability to showcase the full potential of the project requirements and beyond.

### Acknowledgement

Thank you for considering my project. I assure you of my diligence and commitment to maximizing my capabilities given the opportunity.
